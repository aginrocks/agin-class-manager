## **Technologies**:

I built this project's frontend with [shadcn](https://ui.shadcn.com/) components

## Host it yourself:

You can host it by yourself with docker!

_If you want to use something different than traefik, you need to adjust compose file for your needs._

### Dependencies:

- [docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)
- [traefik](https://doc.traefik.io/traefik/getting-started/install-traefik/)

### Run:

#### You first need to edit config.toml file in repo's root folder, this file is mounted inside docker container.

You need to set oidc client and your public url for oidc to work properly.

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

## Development:

### Dependencies:

- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation)
- [rust/cargo](https://rust-lang.org/tools/install/)
